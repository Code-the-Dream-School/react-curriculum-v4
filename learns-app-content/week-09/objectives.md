### Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, we will:

#### Objective 1: Advanced State and useReducer

- Discuss problems of state management in growing applications
- Introduce the reducer pattern
- Describe reducers, dispatches, and actions
- Describe useReducer and how it implements the reducer pattern
- Implement useReducer to combine related state

#### Objective 2: useContext

- Explain the problems that that can be introduced by "prop drilling" and lifting state too high
- Describe how useContext can be implemented in deeply nested components to avoid prop drilling
