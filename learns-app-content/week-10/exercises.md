## Weekly Exercises

The weekly exercises use the following repo:[Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v4-exercises: Exercises for React students](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v4-exercises). Inside the `/src/exercises` directory are weekly folders that each contain an `instructions.md` file and any necessary exercise files. The instructions introduces a scenario and provides several tasks or challenges based on the week's material.
