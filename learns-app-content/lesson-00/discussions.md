### What You'll Get Out of this Course

You will be learning React, a popular user interface (UI) development library used to create interactive web applications. We will build a [todo list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Implementation_of_goals) application over the course of the weekly assignments. We will also complete weekly exercises that that will allow you to practice the topics and techniques discussed each week. With the knowledge gained from this course, you will be equipped with the knowledge to work on real-world React applications!

### Course Structure

#### Curriculum Outline

The Intro to React v4 course is structured as 11 progressive weekly lessons. Each lesson builds upon concepts from previous weeks, making it essential to complete the course sequentially without skipping ahead or missing content.

- **Lessons 1-6** basics of React
- **Lesson 7**  working with data fetched from an API
- **Lesson 8 and 9** advanced hooks
- **Lesson 10** use React-Router to improve web-based navigation
- **Lesson 11** progressing as a React Developer

One of the main requirements for graduation is that all weekly assignments, and any week that includes exercises, must include a link to a [pull request (PR)](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/) that has been reviewed and approved by your assigned reviewer.

The materials for the course is further broken down into a full list of topics covered each week. Every section is titled with their topics so that they double as useful search terms when looking for external resources.

- **Lesson-00:** Course Orientation and Local Environment Setup
- **Lesson-01:** Intro to React, App Installation, and Working with Vite
- **Lesson-02:** ReactDOM, Components, JSX, and Troubleshooting
- **Lesson-03:** Component Lifecycle, Basic Hooks, State, and Props
- **Lesson-04:** Hooks Continued, Events and Handlers
- **Lesson-05:** Local State and Controlled Components, and Forms
- **Lesson-06:** Re-usable Components, Project Organization, and Refactoring
- **Lesson-07:** Data Fetching and UI Update Strategies
- **Lesson-08:** Advanced Hooks: useCallback and useMemo, Optimizing a React App, and API-based Sort/Search
- **Lesson-09:** Advanced State, useReducer, and useContext
- **Lesson-10:** React Router
- **Lesson-11:** Polishing an App for Your Portfolio, App and Data Security, and Deploying a React App

### Weekly Lesson Structure

Each weekly lesson page has the same structure so you'll know where to find specific information where you need it:

1. Learning Objectives
   1. Topics covered
   2. Lesson Objectives
2. Discussion
   1. Introduction
   2. Cover topics in order
   3. Review and Summary
3. Assignments
   1. Weekly Exercises
   2. Todo List Project
4. References and Further Reading

#### 1. Learning Objectives

This section provides an outline of the major topics and summarizes what you're going to learn that week.

#### 2. Discussion

In the discussion portion of each weekly lesson, we will explore each of the listed topics in depth. We will learn key techniques and best practices that developers employ while working with the topics presented. Many coding examples are from another project we'll watch come together: CTD's new eCommerce Store : CTD Swag. No coding for that project is required from you, but if you're interested, the repos for this project can be found here:

- [CTD Swag](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ctd-swag)
- [CTD Swag Backend](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ctd-swag-backend)

#### 3. Assignments

On most weeks you will have two tasks to complete before submitting your assignment form:

- weekly exercises
- enhancing the todo list app

##### Weekly Exercises

The weekly exercises use the following repo:[Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v4-exercises: Exercises for React students](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v4-exercises). Inside the `/src/exercises` directory are weekly folders that each contain an `instructions.md` file and any necessary exercise files. The instructions introduces a scenario and provides several tasks or challenges based on the week's material.

##### Todo List Project

Each week's todo list instructions give you detailed steps to follow, but you'll also have some tasks to figure out on your own. This mix of guided instruction and independent problem-solving keeps the course challenging and interesting. Real developers need to research solutions and solve problems as part of their job. Some tasks may be difficult, but they're designed to be manageable for someone learning React.

A reviewer will look at both PRs to approve them or recommend changes. Any changes will be communicated back via through conversation on your PRs and an Airtable email alert. You'll be expected to make any requested changes before starting the next lesson. If you have questions about the review or need any clarifications, use the conversation tools on the PR page and/or Slack to talk with your reviewer. They are there to help you out!

A step-by-step of how to open a PR can be [found here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). The assignment submission form also includes open-ended mindset questions that will help you start to think like a professional developer.

#### 4. References and Further Reading

Each weekly lesson concludes with a dedicated section that gathers all referenced resources and links in one place, along with additional helpful materials. This makes it easier to quickly find and access useful information without searching through the entire lesson.

### Review and Summary

This course is designed to guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of React, culminating in a final project that showcases your skills. Each week builds on the previous, ensuring a structured and comprehensive learning experience. Assignments and discussions are crafted to encourage both practical coding and critical thinking, preparing you for real-world development.
