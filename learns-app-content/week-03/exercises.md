## Ideas

1. In component X, update the state hook to destructure the return value into a state variable and a state updater function. Don't forget React's naming conventions.
2. Component X mutates a state variable with one of its helper functions. Refactor the function so that it updates the state correctly.
3.
   1. Update component X so that it passes component Y a state variable set to an `intialValue` of 42
   2. Update component Y to display that value `<span>` instance that uses the className of "answer"
