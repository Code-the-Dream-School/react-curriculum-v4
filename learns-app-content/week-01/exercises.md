## Weekly Exercises

The weekly exercises use the following repo: [Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v4-exercises: Exercises for React students](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v4-exercises). Be sure to look over the README prior to forking the repo.

Inside the `/src/exercises` directory are weekly folders that each contain an `instructions.md` file and any necessary exercise files. The instructions introduce a scenario and provides several tasks or challenges based on the week's material.

> [!WARNING]
> **Always work on your own forked repository. Do NOT create pull requests against the original Code-the-Dream-School repository.**
