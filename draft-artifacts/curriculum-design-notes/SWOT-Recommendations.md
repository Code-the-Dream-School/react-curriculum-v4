# SWOT Analysis Recommendations for Copilot Instructions

## Immediate Improvements

### Add Technical Validation Section

Include specific checks for React code examples, props consistency, and import/export correctness.

**Action Items:**

- [x] Add section for validating JSX syntax and React patterns
- [x] Include checklist for props naming consistency across components
- [x] Specify validation of import/export statements
- [x] Add guidance for checking component naming conventions

### Create Review Checklists

Develop structured lists for different content types.

**Action Items:**

- [x] Create assignment review checklist
- [x] Create discussion content review checklist
- [x] Create exercise review checklist
- [x] Add code example validation checklist

### Specify Error Categories

Define what constitutes critical vs. minor issues.

**Action Items:**

- [x] Define "Critical" errors (code won't work, breaks student workflow)
- [x] Define "Important" errors (confusing but non-breaking)
- [x] Define "Minor" errors (cleanup items, typos)
- [x] Add severity guidelines for review prioritization

## Medium-term Enhancements

### Educational Standards

Add pedagogical guidelines for curriculum review.

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Include appropriate complexity progression guidelines
- [ ] Add prerequisite knowledge validation requirements
- [ ] Specify beginner-friendly explanation standards
- [ ] Include scaffolding and support guidance

### Cross-lesson Validation

Include instructions for checking curriculum progression.

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add requirements for checking concept building across weeks
- [ ] Include validation of forward/backward references
- [ ] Specify consistency checks for terminology and examples
- [ ] Add progression difficulty validation

### Accessibility Guidelines

Add requirements for inclusive content review.

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Include alt text validation for images
- [ ] Add color contrast considerations for screenshots
- [ ] Specify inclusive language guidelines
- [ ] Include accessibility pattern validation in code examples

## Long-term Considerations

### Automated Validation

Consider tooling for code example validation.

**Future Options:**

- [ ] Investigate ESLint integration for code blocks
- [ ] Consider automated link checking
- [ ] Explore markdown validation automation
- [ ] Research React code snippet testing tools

### Review Metrics

Develop quality indicators for review effectiveness.

**Measurement Ideas:**

- [ ] Track common error types to improve guidelines
- [ ] Monitor student feedback on clarity improvements
- [ ] Measure review consistency across different reviewers
- [ ] Assess impact of changes on student success rates

### Community Guidelines

Expand for broader contributor participation.

**Expansion Areas:**

- [ ] Create contributor onboarding for curriculum reviews
- [ ] Develop style guides for external contributors
- [ ] Add community review process documentation
- [ ] Create mentorship guidelines for new reviewers
